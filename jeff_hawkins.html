<p class="blogtitle">The Challenge of Challenging Your Beliefs</p>

<p>While reading <span style='text-decoration:underline'>On Intelligence</span> by Jeff Hawkins a couple of years ago, I was struck with a notion that I haven't been able to shake since. The book describes the mechanism he believes to be operating in the neocortex that acts as the basis for intelligence. He postulates ways of mimicking the processes of the neocortex in artificial intelligence, which is no doubt of interest, but not my primary focus. The main idea of intelligence that he puts forward revolves around pattern recognition and the predictive abilities of human brains or theoretical thinking machines alike.</p>

<p>This led me to think about how I viewed the idea of intelligence and the corollaries thereof. What stuck out to me was the idea that an exposure to a wide set of patterns allows the neocortex to develop a better understanding and model of the world on which to make predictions. While this seems somewhat obvious when framed as the notion that more exposure/travel/knowledge of different subjects tends develop a more well rounded individual, I found myself taking it a step further.</p>

<p>I decided: not only is there a fundamental need to grow through discovery of new experiences (both academic and existential) but there it is also a necessity that one continually examine the patterns of one's own thinking to ultimately find ways to challenge/expose those biases. For me that involved being frank and honest with what I truly assume to be the axioms of the world around meâ€”the most prominent being my rather unshakable faith in belief that a pursuit of logic and reasoning is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of my study in Mathematics and really most of my formative years, I have had an unending and innate feeling that while we may never know or understand the principles that dictate the universe as we experience it, there is a basis of logical presets (namely mathematical logic) that gives rise to the seeming chaos. While I don't consider myself a determinist and I think the variables involved in understanding the universe are an unimaginably large set, I do/did believe that given enough data there are ways to know the basic structure of any part of the universe.</p>

<p>This belief has always bred a desire to accumulate as much knowledge of rational logic as a driving force to my life. Periodically I like to ruminate on what it would mean for either this axiom to be inherently false or for the drive to maximize knowledge as being developmentally detrimental/antithetical to the human condition. I find acceptance of the former idea much more palatable than the latter. </p>

<p>To believe that there is not order to the chaos of the universe is actually a surprisingly clear concept to me. I attribute this notion to my father in a discussion over quantum mechanics years back: any fact/hypothesis/idea that lacks falsifiability, and thus brings little-to-no value, allows me to easily accept a purely chaotic world view. While it may be damaging to my belief in the objectivity of Mathematics and most realms of physics, I find it genuinely agreeable that there is no rhyme or reason the nature of existence.</p>

<p>Much more subtle and harder to dislodge is my dedication to the rational side of thinking. To challenge this in my mind is incredibly difficult but my approach generally is to forgo a metric and try to accept that experience regardless of objectivity grows the mind. For better or dramatically worse, the brain seems amazingly well suited to grow from both positive and negative experiences. </p>

<p>Examining these areas of my thought process might be an incredibly vain endeavor with minimal external value but I find it allows me to be less emotionally tied to my beliefs. In being less invested, it becomes easier to empathize with others as well as gives me a more rigid definition of my own beliefs when trying to explain them to others. This pays rather large dividends in personal interactions as well as facilitates much smoother, more productive professional relationships.
