<p>While building a client site recently, I was in the process of trudging out the same CSS selectors over and over again when I ran into niche scenario that made me stop to think for a second. The particular issue is not entirely relevant but it got me  thinking about which would be more performant: a pseudo-class like :first-child or a plain class name.</p>

<p>The computational power used to render CSS is obviously dependent on the client machine, so I decided to approach this by looking quickly at the theoretical impacts of these two different selectors by running a series of timed tests—fun and games in my book.</p>

<p>Both the :first-child and a distinct class name fall into the same general category of CSS specificity but the single class name seems, at first glance, to be slightly less computationally demanding. The reason being: a child element needs to reference its parent element in the DOM tree not just check its own class attribute. Since CSS is interpreted RTL (<a href='http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/css-parent-selectors' target='_blank'>referenced here</a>), it would seem that just searching for a match in the class name would result in faster solution to applying a selected style.</p>

<p>For the testing, I kept things as simple possible: a completely blank HTML document with increasing amounts of DOM elements that would need styling. I was using time  elapsed before the DOM was completely rendered as a metric to measure which was more or less efficient. This was done on a 13inch MacBook Pro running OSX 10.7.5 and using Chrome Version 44.0.2403.157 (64-bit).</p>

<p>As a control, the blank page with no elements or style loaded in an average time of 5ms.</p>

<table class='blog_table' cellspacing="0">
	<thead>
		<th>Selector</th>
		<th>Avg. Load Time<br>(1 Item)</th>
		<th>Avg. Load Time<br>(100 Items)</th>
		<th>Avg. Load Time<br>(1,000 Items)</th>
		<th>Avg. Load Time<br>(10,000 Items)</th>
	</thead>
	<tr>
		<td style="text-align:left">:first-child</td>
		<td>8ms</td>
		<td>9ms</td>
		<td>27ms</td>
		<td>1133ms</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="text-align:left">single class</td>
		<td>6ms</td>
		<td>8ms</td>
		<td>20ms</td>
		<td>1100ms</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>Obviously this is a rather simplistic test but at the same time it captures well the minor difference in rendering. I was honestly surprised that the :first-child select managed to stay so closely to the class name. While this doesn't begin to touch on the subject of code readability or the negligible about of extra data that needs to be transmitted by adding a class name to a series of elements, it does show that even as the DOM can start to get large that both actually perform with a similar efficacy.</p>
