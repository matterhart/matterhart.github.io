	<p class="blogtitle">Musings on responsive design</p>

<p>The term “responsive design” gets tossed around rather liberally in the web development field and while the trope may be a touch tired, it does highlight a useful piece of the design process. For illustrative purpose, I will define “responsive design” as: UX continuity across multiple device platforms. The general approach to this continuity being relatively static content designed to best target each platform.</p>

<p>As with any project, it's best to start by attempting to document all of the functionality ahead of time. It isn't always viable to create an exhaustive list but a generally granular list is normally achievable. After creating a functionality list, determining what devices (mobile, tablet and desktop) require which actions is the next best step. An example of this use-case scenario would include sending a customized download link to a user's mobile device—an action that fits well on the tablet and desktop lists but is superfluous for a mobile user already viewing the page.</p>

<p>Following up from the UX action list, I tend to attempt generating assets for proposed layouts—a process during which properly targeting each device becomes critical.  At Microsoft's developer convention (<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/3-541" target="_blank">Build 2014</a>), I happened to sit in on a good session covering how to design across multiple form factors. The general conclusion, which I tend to follow as well, is to only worry about two screen sizes when generating assets: one for high-resolution tablet and desktop screens, and another for the lighter payload of mobile devices that scales appropriately to the smaller screen.</p>

<p>These may seem like incredibly basics steps to take when developing an experience that translates well across a myriad of devices but they do set a solid foundation for to build from. Getting too caught up in making sure that every width is a percentage, every font-size an EM and every margin spacing is pixel-perfect can obfuscate the goal line of delivering a solid web site. From this basis, one can very easily create a fluid, content-rich interaction for a user with ease.
