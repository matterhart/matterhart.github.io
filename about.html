	<h2>A little about me</h2>
	<p>While my friends preferred the youthful joys of Legos and Pokemon cards, my childhood passions found me tinkering with all things electronic. Toying around with components in a 300-in-1 electronic set? Tasking myself with fixing qBasic code retyped from a library book to make games work? Standard, willful undertakings during my youth that shaped my vocation today.</p>

	<p>As I pursued an undergraduate degree in Theoretical Mathematics at the University of Arizona, I indulged my love of programming as a Student Developer crafting an assortment of Flash-based learning tools for the Institute of Supply Management. During my senior year, I began as a Support Analyst for the Bio5 Institute, whereupon I was promoted to Developer and solidified my skillset in the LAMP stack.</p>

	<p>Graduation and the allure of the Pacific Northwest found me settling in Seattle. I began a thriving career as a Developer at Slalom Consulting, where I specialized in C# and the .Net stack, carving out custom solutions for a breadth of internal departments. My personal pursuits also afforded me the chance to become proficient in Python and Ruby on Rails through various freelance projects. My thirst for learning is one never entirely quenched. </p>

	<p>After a rewarding four-year journey at Slalom, I've decided to focus my attention towards a more diverse set of web and application driven development projects.  Gaining exposure to new sets of technologies is paramount to my growth as a Developer. In tandem with my freelance adventures, I fill my time with taking full advantage of the plentiful Washington state backpacking trails and coaching regularly at my local CrossFit gym after becoming a Level 1 CrossFit trainer in May 2015.</p>
